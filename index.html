                My strengths are my attitude that I like to take challenges that I CAN do it, my way of thinking that I take both success and failure in a balanced manner..
                I don't like to say weakness but i like to say scope for improvement that is I wont leave any ask in completely, I believe in my self and my hard work.

                My short term goal is I want a such a platform where i can grow my career along with the organization growth and
                my long term goal is I want to be one of the reason for the success of the organization.
